  <strong>Welcome to the Wav2Lip Google Colab!</strong>
  <br>
  This project aims to demonstrate the lip-syncing capabilities of the Wav2Lip model using Google Colab's interactive environment. With this Colab notebook, you can easily sync speech from an audio file with the lip movements in a video, creating a lip-synced video output.
</div>

**Note:** This project utilizes the Wav2Lip model, which is trained to perform lip-syncing. The notebook runs on Google Colab, enabling you to use this functionality without the need for local installations.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Wav2Lip project in Google Colab:

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**
   <br>Click on the following link to access the Wav2Lip Google Colab notebook:
   <br>[Open Wav2Lip Google Colab Notebook](link_to_google_colab_notebook)

2. **Upload Input Media**
   <br>In the Colab notebook, navigate to the section where input media files are required. Ensure you have the following media files ready:
   - `input_video.mp4`: Input video file that you want to lip-sync.
   - `input_audio.wav`: Input audio file that contains the speech for lip-syncing.
   
   Upload these files directly into the Colab notebook. You can do this by clicking on the folder icon in the left sidebar and then clicking "Upload" to select the files from your local machine.

3. **Run the Lip-Syncing Process**
   <br>Once you have uploaded the input media files, proceed to the section of the notebook where the lip-syncing process is implemented. Follow the provided instructions and execute the code cells to generate the lip-synced video output.

4. **View and Save the Output**
   <br>After the lip-syncing process is complete, the output video will be displayed within the Colab notebook. You can view the output directly in the notebook. If you wish to save the output video, follow the provided instructions to download it to your local machine.
